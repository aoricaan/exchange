# Api Exchange
***

NOTE: use of limiter and authorizer are for demonstration purposes only, use in production is not recommended 

## Run Locally
To run the commands you must be on the root of the repository


### Local execution
NOTE: You must be having installed python3.7 or higher in your local machine
### LINUX:
``python -m venv venv``

``./venv/bin/activate``

``pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt``

``uvicorn app.app:app --reload --port [port number]``
### WINDOWS
``python -m venv venv``

``.\venv\Scripts\activate``

``pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt``

``uvicorn app.app:app --reload --port [port number]``

this will start the server to the default host: localhost:[port number]

you can see the swagger documentations in: localhost:[port number]/docs

### Local execution on docker

To run on docker you must run the next lines:

``docker build -t [image name] .``

``docker run -d --name [container name] -p 80:80 [image name]``


NOTE: if you donÂ´t specify the port number docker won't expose the image to a host (in this case locally)


## Try the api

To try the api running in local run:

[token]: you can find the token in ./app/properties file

``
curl -X 'GET' 
  'http://127.0.0.1:[port number]/exchange' 
  -H 'accept: application/json' 
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer [token]'
``

to try the api deployed in heroku run:

``
curl -X 'GET' 
  'https://exchange-api-c.herokuapp.com/exchange' 
  -H 'accept: application/json' 
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer token'
``


## For unittest
To run the unittest and coverage run the next lines:

``coverage run -m unittest discover``

`` coverage html -d coverage_html``

after run the last command you can find a folder with the name "coverage html" open the index.html file inside and filter by "app/" for show only the app coverage
